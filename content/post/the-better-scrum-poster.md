I rarely use projectors or computers while facilitating meetings. There are occasions where those kind of tools are perfect, but my main reason for not using them is my style of facilitation; I'm much more comfortable with a whiteboard (or a flip chart) and a  set of coloured markers.

However, there is one specific exception to this, and that's when the meeting is related to the subject of Scrum. On these occasions I keep one image ready to be presented. This image depicts the full Scrum framework.

There are of course a plethora of images depicting the Scrum framework. A simple image search on Google gives all kinds of examples.

I've found that with Mark Hoogveld's "graphical overview of Scrumâ€™s roles, events, artefacts and some of the rules that bind them together"[^n] I have a complete, yet minimalistic, image of the framework.
