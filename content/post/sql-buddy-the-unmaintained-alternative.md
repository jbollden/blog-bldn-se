If you, as I, think that [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is a useful tool but unnecessarily complex in regards of installation and user experience, then [SQL Buddy](http://sqlbuddy.com/) might be the alternative for you.

SQL Buddy is a web based administration tool for MySQL written in PHP. This tool is simple to use, yet potent enough to meet all the basic and some of the advanced needs one might have when working with MySQL databases.

However, there is a drawback, SQL Buddy is no longer maintained and developed. Though, the [licence](https://github.com/calvinlough/sqlbuddy/blob/master/LICENSE) of the software admits you to develop it further. And the forums are quite active and contributors are very helpful.

On a side note I also like to mention [SIDU](http://sidu.sourceforge.net/), which is another free web based database client. Installation and usage is as simple as SQL Buddy. I prefer SQL Buddy over SIDU because the GUI of SQL Buddy is more appealing to me and I rarely have the need for an advanced point-and-click-GUI when it comes to MySQL.
