I’ve been given this amazing opportunity that would be outright stupid to turn down, and I’m usually not stupid. I’ll be taking on the position as team manager at the consultancy [Sogeti](https://www.sogeti.se/)  here in Luleå. I’m looking forward to return to my old firm where I spent five years and eight months at the office of Linköping.

Through this I will off course be putting myself to the test. As always, I’m humbled before the task(s) at hand, but I believe I can do some good together with my new colleagues.
