This post is as much a suggestion to you as it is a reminder to myself.

Experiences are important parts of life; it's something we accumulate more or less throughout our lives. Wikipedia reads:

> Experience is the knowledge or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.[^1]

However, there is another side to this which the following quote tries to illustrate:

> Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.[^2]

My point is that we all have experiences, and since our experiences most likely will differ the use of experience as argument should be avoided in all situations but one; when someone asks you for your experience.

*Experience can help us keep safe though.*
