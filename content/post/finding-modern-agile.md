Being the longtime, die hard Scrum advocate that I know I am, it’s with somewhat mixed emotions I’ve just now discovered [Modern Agile](http://modernagile.org/).

> Modern Agile is ultra-light, the opposite of mainstream Agile, which is drowning in a bloated tangle of enterprise tools, scaling frameworks and questionable certificates that yield more bureaucracy than results.[^n]

The four principles, values, cornerstones, or whatever you want to call them, are elegant distillations of my beloved Scrum and certainly of all of the agile frameworks and toolboxes:

* Make people awesome
* Make safety a prerequisite
* Experiment and learn rapidly
* Deliver value continuously

However, I would probably not understand this ultra-lightness and the four principles as easy(?) if I didn’t come from other agile experiences.

I am quite intrigued, and very curious to explore Modern Agile from my latest standpoint; that of me being a manager.

There’s lot to explore, digest, learn, and perhaps even internalise from finding Modern Agile.
