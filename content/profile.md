**Core: Husband, tunnel-rat, shooter, servant-leader; Work: Team Manager at Sogeti Lule√•.**

With an evolved ability to structure and lead development related work I'm always in search of sustainable solutions for the customer. This I do with catchwords like *simplicity* and *clarity* in mind.

I've been in the IT-industry for more than 15 years and have a high general technical understanding.  The quest of learning anew is important, as is to question what I already know. By constantly trying to evolve I believe I can do a better job, regardless the task at hand.
