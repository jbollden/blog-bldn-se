In July of 2016 the Scrum guide was updated, thus adding the Scrum values mentioned in the great "[Agile Development with Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Software-Development-Scrum/dp/0130676349)". The text reads as follows, with me highlighting the five values:

> When the values of <mark>commitment</mark>, <mark>courage</mark>, <mark>focus</mark>, <mark>openness</mark> and <mark>respect</mark> are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum events, roles and artifacts.[^n]

[Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/) published a discussion on these changes (and more) on YouTube: [Scrum Guide Refresh July 2016 - Scrum Pulse Episode #14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hRZffDD1ec). Another great piece is a short interview from DZone with Ken Schwaber: [Ken Schwaber On the Five Values of Scrum](https://dzone.com/articles/ken-schwaber-on-the-five-values-of-scrum)

I find that these values can and should be used outside the software industry, even outside the realm of work.
