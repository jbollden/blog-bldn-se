I joined the [tribe](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tribe)! 

This July I had the utmost priviliege to be part of [SoLEAD](https://www.sogeti.com/join-us/solead/)16; the 16<sup>th</sup> class of Sogeti Leadership Academy. 26 collegues from across the world gathered under the safe wings of our facilitators [Dian Lens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianlens/) and [Mandy Sol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandy-sol-6346492/). For three intense days we shared, cared, told and networked at the Capgemini Campus [Serge Kampf Les Fontaines](https://www.les-fontaines.com/en/), a good one hour car ride north of Paris, France.

Below is the description of this awesome programme:

> **What is SoLEAD?** 

> Leadership is about inspiring people and getting them to achieve collective goals. 

> The SoLEAD program focuses on developing collective leadership skills such as focus, trust, and collective intelligence. It also offers a unique opportunity for participants to network and share experiences with other leaders from Sogeti and across the Group, to reflect and contribute to building the future of Sogeti. 

> SoLEAD has been active for several years now and uses the tagline of ‘The Power of the Tribe’. The program brings together current and future leaders across grades, with diverse backgrounds and roles, across the Sogeti world, for an exciting learning experience.  

>  **Why SoLEAD?**

> * Focus on Collective Leadership: SoLEAD focuses on personal development and collective leadership skills by leveraging leaders’ personal awareness, their ability to facilitate collaboration and create collective engagement in their teams. The collective approach of the program ensures accountability and co-responsibility among all team members; making everyone responsible for each other and the team’s overall success and failure. 
> * A Unique Networking Opportunity: SoLEAD offers the unique opportunity for participants to network and share experiences with other leaders from across the Group. The event is also an opportunity to interact with members of the top management from our company; collectively reflect and contribute to building the future of Sogeti. 
> * Experiential & Disruptive: The SoLEAD program utilizes various tools that are designed to help understand how a team is a relationship system with its own inherent intelligence. Some key outcomes of SoLEAD are: 
>   - The permission to fail and rediscover trust from a fresh perspective 
>   - Tapping into the ‘wisdom’ and energy field of a team, to respect all voices, to increase positivity and team interactions, and to create empowerment 
>   - Setting inspiring goals, taking into account emotions around the goal 
>   - Becoming aware of weaknesses: learn how to step out of own comfort zone and allow oneself to grow.
