Both me and [my wife](http://karinbollden.se/en/) have been recruited by [Luleå University of Technology](http://www.ltu.se/?l=en). As of September 1st she will begin her work as a Educational Developer with special responsibility for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at University Pedagogy Centre (HPC), and I as a Project Manager at IT Services (ITS) with responsibilities for the public and portal websites. We are both very grateful for these opportunities and look forward to start a new and exiting chapter in our lives. 

In 2001 we moved from Älvsbyn to Skövde and then to Linköping in 2009. So after 15 years in the south time has come for us to change scenery yet again. The plan is to move in mid-August. We believe our accumulated experiences from the time spent down south will benefit our new city. Personally, I believe my passion for Scrum will be a great addition to the area of Norrbotten. 

Before we leave we will in some way organise a farewell party in Linköping. Information on this will be provided later on.
